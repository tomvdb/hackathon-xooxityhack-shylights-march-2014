The basic concept is a hallway with lights hanging from the ceiling. As you walk towards them they lift up and you can walk underneath them. When you have passed they come done again. The prototype was built using a RAMPS board (commonly used in 3d printers), motion sensors and some stepper motors (and a lot of duct tape and hot glue).

Our team consisted of a guys and gals from HelloComputer and BinarySpace:

* Kerry Friend
* Jade Amic
* Ryan Groenewald
* Munyaradzi Nyikavaranda
* Riniel Gresse
* Nathan Gates
* Tom Van den Bon
